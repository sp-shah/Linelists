chmasseron_fixed.moog : shared by APJ. OK in case anyone wants a MOOG version of the fixed Masseron14 linelist, here it is. I subtracted 14.11 cm^-1 from the expot as the lowest energy across all the CH lines. https://www.dropbox.com/s/f2lmdiali5yijw2/chmasseron_fixed.moog?dl=0
chmasseron_fixed_editsShah.moog : narrowd down the wavelength range. Probably 3000 to 9000 (not sure)
